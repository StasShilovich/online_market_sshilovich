                    value="The article “Roles of Sensitive Men” by Gerald Thompson that appeared in the magazine The Watcher can be said to be an extended argument with gaping holes. Thompson presents sensitive men as the new gatekeepers of the future, the ones that will lead the most influential companies and make the greatest mark in the field of humanities. Thompson makes it all sound like a new race of human beings will descend on our lonely planet. While the author has some insight, much of the article is based on bias and speculation rather than actual research."/>

The article is rather expository than analytical or descriptive, and mostly uses data from external sources and research, which shows the level of customers’ satisfaction with the mentioned services today remains rather low—on the levels of the 1970s. The article, however, does not seem to have any significant background, which could be, for example, a rapid decline of brands’ popularity, or the mass bankruptcy of companies; at least nothing like that is mentioned in the text."/>

                    value="“The Role of God” by George Hammond, published in the opinion magazine Grass Over Grass, is ambitious in that its primary focus is a being that is perceived to be infinite. Hammond directs attention initially to the fact that God cannot be seen, in its pure form, thus cancelling out a specific role for it since we cannot get physically acquainted with its presence. The author continues his argumentation by stating that, “The roleless God has a role in our lives. It moves us to think deeply about nothingness, mystery, and what we simply cannot explain” (Hammond 56). "/>

The author believes felons need to be deprived of their voting rights for life as a symbolic price they have to pay for violating certain social and legal norms. The article is structured in an unusual and, in my opinion, an effective manner. It first presents the arguments of those supporting the idea of re-enfranchising felons, and then provides the author’s reasons not to agree with the idea."/>

The article Impact of Technology on Politics attempts to analyze how these two spheres of modern life, technology and politics, interrelate and what the outcomes are of this interrelationship. Political candidates use technology in many ways. Different communication channels provided by the Internet have the power to influence the growth of different individuals in their respective spheres. The likes of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are powerful communication media platforms that can easily raise the ratings of political candidates. Housley claims that whether we acknowledge it or not, technology is a deciding factor in most political races. Through technology, politicians are able to access funds, gain political pundits, and spend less on campaigning and pushing their candidacy."/>

The current paper is aimed at analyzing an article, “The Living Conditions of U.S.-Born Children of Mexican Immigrants in Unmarried Families,” published in the “Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences.” The studies presented in the article demonstrate that the children of immigrants of Mexican origin are prone to high risks of a socioeconomic nature within US society. The paper concentrates on the children of immigrants of Mexican origin, and more specifically, those that live in unmarried families. Mexican immigrants, in most cases, have considerably lower levels of employment, or are unemployed, as well as their education level is minimal."/>

It is a rocky beach in the city of Richmond Beach, which can be accessed by a long downhill drive (by car or bicycle) from the city of Edmonds. Or, as I did often, took the 30-minute walk from my house to the calm waters through a tranquil stroll through the woods of Woodway. It used to be a place inhabited by Native Americans, but now it is occupied by mostly Caucasian people. However, a totem pole stands in tribute to the tribes that used to call the beach home. It has a vast property, with a beach, a playground, two upper lawns for the view and recreation, myriad “secret” trails along the clay hillsides, picnic areas, and a square where people can walk around, take an outdoor rinse-shower after a swim, and benches for the spectacular view."/>

We have many holy books, manuals on living, and self-help tomes. However, I feel this is the most exacting moral code in terms of a social context. By social context, I mean how we interact with others and behave in social situations. Though “be constructive, not destructive” sounds sensible, there are many nuances. Sometimes it is difficult to determine if an act is exactly constructive or destructive. In the following paragraphs, these nuances will be discussed in detail."/>

Is there any scientific basis for the soul? Surprisingly, there is. Each unique personality a person has (even in circumstances of amnesia and other illnesses), the feeling and identity of the self beyond age (especially experienced as we grow older), and our inevitable subjective experience as an individual comprise a scientific foundation for the soul. Despite neuroplasticity, or the  constant shift in the links between our brain cells, we remain essentially the same personality. This consistency is most stark in the case of mentally ill patients or people who have experienced memory loss."/>

                    value="The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is perhaps the most popular set of novels of the modern era. With seven books and many blockbuster films to its name, the series has amassed about 15 billion dollars in sales. How did this phenomenon become what it is? For those scratching their heads, the reason can be broken down into several areas: Rowling garnered a generous initial contract for her book, separate book covers were created for both teens and adults, midnight releases/promotions/pre-orders made the public more fanatic about the series, and fan blogs were rampant. In fact, these are just a few of the main reasons why the Harry Potter took off the way it did."/>

That is why countless people type in “how to get rid of stretch marks” in internet search engines to discover how to solve this issue. In this essay, we will focus on practical ways of making stretch marks disappear by various methods: consuming more Vitamin A, using a sugar scrub, employing aloe vera, taking hyaluronic acid through capsules, and applying coconut oil. Getting stretch marks out by consuming vitamin A seems like a stretch, but it is a home remedy that is trusted. In fact, a lot of issues we have can be solved by the intake of more vitamins. According to Healthline, “Vitamin A is referred to as a retinoid. Retinoids make skin appear smoother and more youthful. They’re used in many over-the-counter topical cosmetic creams. "/>

He makes videos on how to prepare relatively simple dishes, such as rice. His method of cooking is as follows: 1) Get 400 grams of rice (preferably basmati). 2) Use cold water to rinse the dust and starch from the rice. 3) Place the rice in a pan. Add some cardamom pods (broken open), star anise, salt, and pepper. 4) Add one and a half part cold water. 5) Get the lid on, bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to let it steam for about 8-10 minutes. 6) Keep the lid on throughout the steaming process. 7) Get the cardamom pods and star anise out, and use a fork to separate the rice a bit by running the fork through the rice a few times. 8) The rice is ready to be served (Shukla, Pragati). This recipe makes for a fragrant and downright delicious basmati rice dish. Serving curry on top of this rice adds to its tastiness."/>

However, with his existence assured by information outside the Bible, there are still many mysteries about him. One such conundrum is when he was born. In fact, “when was Jesus born” is a top search on the internet. There are many theories about when he was born in terms of the year and month, and even day. These theories have been clouded by popular myths, cultural norms, and a lack of concrete evidence.

However, for people who live outside this country (second largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given. Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago.
